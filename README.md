# Neuroevolution Visualizer

Welcome to the NeuroEvolution Visualizer! I built it this project because of my interest in learning algorithms and artificial neural networks. I hope that you enjoy the Visualizer. A live version can be found here: <https://jvioladevelops.github.io/Neuroevolution-Visualizer/>

**Neuroevolution:** In simplest terms uses an evolutionary algorithm to optimize training performance of a neural network in order to solve a problem.

**The Genetic Algorithm:** is a semi-supervised evolutionary algorithm. It does not guarantee the most optimal solution. However! It is functional with partial sets of data. The algorithm mutates the population agents in each generation that have the greatest fitness score. By adjusting the weights and biases of succeedingly better populations, the end result is an agent most properly suited for the problem.

**The Softmax Activation Function:** is bounded between 0, 1, and returns probabilities that sum to 1. It is a great activation function for classification problems.

**Sigmoidal Activation Function:** is continuously differentiable and outputs a value bounded between 0, 1. Sigmoid is a type of squashing function which makes it useful in predicting probabilities.

**The Rectifier Activation Function:** or ReLU is bounded between 0, x. The function will return a 0 for any negative input and for any positive x it returns that value.

**Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network:** Is renowned as the first type of neural network. It has fully connected nodes, where the inputs of one layer are the outputs of another. Information flows in the forward direction from the input nodes.

**Deep Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network:** Follows the same characteristics of the feed forward network (fully connected or dense, and no loops) but has multiple layers of hidden nodes.
